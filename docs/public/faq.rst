*************************************************
Why “django-*hvad*”?
*************************************************

The project first started as “django-*nani*”, created by Jonas Obrist. The word
*nani* is the romanized form of “なに”, which means *What?*.

When Kristian Øllegaard took responsibility for updating and maintaining the project,
including a major refactor of the internals, the project was renamed to *hvad*,
which is the Danish word for *What?*.

If we were to continue the trend, we would rename to django-*quoi*, but that is
very unlikely unless Django introduces major breaking changes in a future version.

.. _translatable-str:

***********************************************************
How do I properly define my __str__ with translated fields?
***********************************************************

It is very common that the string representation of a model includes a
translated field in some way. For instance::

    class MyModel(TranslatableModel):
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            name=models.CharField(max_length=100),
        )

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name

Unfortunately, this approach will fail or behave in odd ways when,
for some reason, an attempt is made to display an untranslated model.
This commonly happens while debugging, and can make it really hard
to pinpoint issues. The recommended way to solve this is to check
whether a translation is loaded, like this::

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name if self.translations.active else str(self.pk)

Now, if no translation is loaded, the primary key of the model is
returned instead, avoiding a database query. The same thing should
be done with other methods that may be used with untranslated instances,
for instance :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save` or
:meth:`~django.db.models.Model.get_absolute_url`.

*************************************************
How do I get the right language from the request?
*************************************************

In most cases, you will be using :ref:`language() <language-public>` with no
arguments in your views and forms. When used with no arguments, it defaults
to using the current language, as returned by Django's
:func:`~django.utils.translation.get_language`.

Therefore, having hvad use the right language is mostly a matter of having
Django setting it right. Fortunately, Django provide the tools to do this,
in the form of the :class:`~django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware`. Here is
a short guide to making it work.

First, the middleware must be enabled. This is done by adding
``'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware'`` to :setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`
in you settings file.

- It must come after :class:`~django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`.
- If you use the ``CacheMiddleware``, then the ``LocaleMiddleware`` must come after
  that too.
- Right after those, as close to the top as possible, should the ``LocaleMiddleware``
  come::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware',
    )

Now, the middleware will try to determine the user's language preference. There is
a detailed explanation of how it proceeds in
:djterm:`Django documentation <how-django-discovers-language-preference>`.

Hvad will happily follow the language discovered by the middleware. Although this
will usually be enough, you may sometimes want to force the language. Either
on a specific request by explicitly passing a language code to
:ref:`language() <language-public>`, or by changing the current language. The
later is done through :func:`~django.utils.translation.activate`.


***************************
How about multilingual URI?
***************************

We will assume the URI we want to be multilingual are made of two kind of components:
static components, and dynamic components. We want to translate both kind:

- Static components, through :func:`~django.utils.translation.ugettext_lazy`.
- Dynamic components, from our translatable models.

Static components
=================

This is thoroughly documented in Django's
:djterm:`URL i18n documentation <url-internationalization>` and does not actually
involve hvad, so this will be a short guide. It requires the
:class:`~django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware` to be properly
:ref:`configured <localemiddleware>`, so please do that first.

With this middleware active, each request will set a current language before
looking up the URI in your ``urlconf.py``. This makes it possible to use
:func:`~django.utils.translation.ugettext_lazy` in your patterns, like this::

    from django.conf.urls import url
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    urlpatterns = [
        url(_(r'^en/news/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/(?P<slug>.*)'),
            views.NewsView, name='news-detail'),
    ]

The pattern would then appear in the list of translatable string, making it
possible to add, for instance, a translation that would read
``^fr/actualites/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month>[0-9]{2})/(?P<slug>.*)``

.. note:: Notice the language code at the beginning. Although not required,
          prefixing your URI with it makes the life much easier to the
          :class:`~django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware`.

Dynamic components
==================

We translated the static parts of the URI with Django mechanics. What now?
Well, if we touch nothing, everything will work fine: the language of the user
will be used for URI resolution, and then hvad's :ref:`language() <language-public>`
will follow the same. Database queries will filter on the user's language
by default, and your view will 404 if nothing is found in that language.

Now, in some instances, the language might not be known. Because your URI does
not include a language code, or because you want to find objects regardless
of the user's language. Maybe based on a translatable slug. This can be done
by querying with ``language('all')``::

    from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView

    class NewsView(TemplateView):
        def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            slug = kwargs['slug']
            obj = News.objects.language('all').get(published=True, slug=slug)

            context = self.get_context_data(news=obj, language=obj.language_code)
            return self.render_to_response(context)

This view will find the news given its slug, regardless of which language it
is in. It will display it in the language it is found with. It would be possible
to force it to be in the user's preferred language by adding another query::

    obj = News.objects.language('all').get(published=True, slug=slug)
    try:
        # Try to replace obj with a version in current user's language
        obj = News.objects.language().get(pk=obj.pk)
    except News.DoesNotExist:
        # No translation for user's language, stick with that of the slug
        pass

.. note:: Note those examples assume slugs are unique amongst all news of all
          languages.


.. _no-translated-many:

***********************************************************
Why are ManyToManyFields not supported as TranslatedFields?
***********************************************************

The central paradigm of hvad is making a :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatableModel`
behave like it is a regular model. This means, from other models,
that translations are not normally visible as a separate entity.
They are just drop-in replacements for field values.

There is inherent ambiguity in “translating a ManyToManyField”. Depending on
specific situtation, this could mean:

    * Make target object translatable. This is supported, it is a **untranslated**
      ManyToManyField, pointing at another translatable model.
    * Have the relation change depending on the language. This breaks hvad
      paradigm, by making other models (namely, the ManyToMany target and the
      through model) aware of the existence of specific translations.
    * Have translatable fields on the through model. This is supported, as
      long as neither the forward nor the backward foreign keys are translatable.
      If they were, the relation would change depending on the language, and
      we would be back to previous case.

If you find yourself in case #2, this means you are not just adding translations
to your database. Rather, your database interacts with language in a complex way,
which you must design by yourself. This is beyond the scope of model translation
packages like hvad.

If you still want to use some of hvad facilities to design such a complex
interaction, check out :issue:`this ticket <284>`.

****************************
How do I use hvad with MPTT?
****************************

The `mptt`_ application implements Modified Preorder Tree Traversal
for Django models. If you have any model in your project that is organized
in a hierarchy of items, you should be using it.

MPTT and hvad can cooperate pretty well by merging the ``TranslationManager``
from hvad with the ``MPTTManager`` from MPTT.
Doing so is relatively straightforward::

    class FolderManager(TranslationManager, MPTTManager):
        use_for_related_fields = True

    class Folder(MPTTModel, TranslatableModel):
        # ...
        objects = FolderManager()

The same principle would work with a custom queryset too, but MPTT does not
define one.

***********************************************
How do I separate translatable fields in admin?
***********************************************

This comes froms :issue:`68`.

We need to separate the fields in fieldsets. Unfortunately, technical
restrictions on Django < 1.6 make support for translated fields directly
on ModelAdmin difficult. Therefore, it must be worked around by defining a
custom :meth:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_fieldsets` as such::

    class MyModelAdmin(TranslatableAdmin):
        # ... other admin stuff
        def get_fieldsets(self, request, obj=None):
            return (
                (_('Common fields'), {
                    'fields': ('owner', 'is_published',),
                }),
                (_('Translated fields'), {
                    'fields': ('name', 'slug', 'description',),
                }),
            )

The model admin will then be generated with two fieldsets, one for common fields
and one for translated fields. At this point though, language tabs still appear
at the top, with both fieldsets beneath. This can be changed by providing a
custom template for rendering the form. This is a 2-step process. First, we
specify a custom template on the admin::

    class MyModelAdmin(TranslatableAdmin):
        # ... ohter admin stuff
        change_form_template = 'myapp/change_form.html'

Then we create the template, by extending the base admin change form. Only, we
place the language tabs where we want them to be:

.. code-block:: django

    {% extends "admin/change_form.html" %}

    {% block field_sets %}
        {% for fieldset in adminform %}
            {% include "admin/includes/fieldset.html" %}
            {% if forloop.first %}
                {% include "admin/hvad/includes/translation_tabs.html" %}
            {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

In that example, the language tabs will end up in between the first and second
fieldsets. We are mostly done, all we miss is some CSS rules to have the tabs
look right. We may simply copy-paste the ``extrahead`` block straight from
``hvad/templates/admin/hvad/change_form.html``.

.. note:: Remember that language tabs are links to other pages. This means that
          clicking them without saving the form will not save anything, not even
          common fields. Basically, a new, fresh form will be built from DB
          values. If adding new object, common fields will be blanked as well.
