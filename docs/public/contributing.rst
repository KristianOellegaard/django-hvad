How to contribute
#################


*****************
Running the tests
*****************

Common Setup
============

* ``virtualenv env``
* ``source env/bin/activate``
* ``pip install django sphinx djangorestframework``

Postgres Setup
==============

Additional to the steps above, install ``psycopg2`` using pip and have a
postgres server running that you have access to with a user that can create
databases.

Mysql Setup
===========

Additional to the steps above, install ``mysql-python`` using pip and have a
mysql server running that you have access to with a user that can create
databases.

Run the test
============

* ``python runtests.py``

Optionally, prefix it with a environment variable called ``DATABASE_URL``, for
example for a Postgres server running on ``myserver.com`` on port ``5432``
with the user ``username`` and password ``password`` and database name ``hvad``:

* ``DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@myserver.com:5432/hvad python runtests.py``

If in doubt, you can check ``.travis.yml`` for some examples.
