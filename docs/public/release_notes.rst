*****************************
2.0.0 beta - current release
*****************************

Released on November 20, 2018

Python and Django versions supported:

- Django 2.1 and newer.
- Python 3.5 and newer.
- Older versions are **not** supported. Please stick to 1.8.0 for older versions.

This is a major release with breaking changes. Please see the
:ref:`migration guide <migrate-hvad-1>`.

Major changes:

- Query engine was refactored to use a parameterized `JOIN` clause.
- Translation caching now works with Django API.
- Automatic loading has been removed, in favor of upfront caching of translations.
- Introspection API was reworked (see the new :ref:`translations <model-translations>` accessor).

As many changes have been introduced, this release might introduce more bugs than usual, which
is why it is flagged as `beta`.

*****************************
1.8.0
*****************************

Released on April 28, 2017

Python and Django versions supported:

- Support for Django 1.10 was added.
- Django 1.7 is no longer supported.
- So, as a reminder, supported Django versions for this release are:
  1.8 LTS, 1.9, 1.10.x (for x ≥ 1) and 1.11.

New features:

- Automatic loading of translations on attribute access can now be disabled,
  by setting ``HVAD["AUTOLOAD_TRANSLATIONS"]`` to ``False``. This will prevent
  hvad from initiating database queries. Accessing translatable attributes with
  no translation loaded will then raise an :exc:`~exceptions.AttributeError`.
- It is possible to automatically install :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset`
  as the default queryset for all translatable models, by setting
  ``HVAD["USE_DEFAULT_QUERYSET"]`` to ``True``. Specifically, it changes
  :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.default_class` to be a
  :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset` instead of a
  :class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet`.
  See the section about
  :ref:`overriding the default queryset <override-default-queryset>`
  for advantages and caveats of doing so.
- Field declaration for internal ``language_code`` attribute can be overriden.
  — :issue:`332`.

Compatibility warnings:

- All settings have been moved to a unique ``HVAD`` dictionary. Please update
  your django settings accordingly.

- Deprecated class :class:`~ hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset` has been removed.
  Using it along with
  :meth:`FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks() <hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks>`
  did not work on Django 1.9 and newer and was deprecated on older versions. Using
  it without that method made it behave like a regular queryset. So as a summary,

    * Code using `.untranslated().use_fallbacks()` must be replaced
      with :ref:`.language().fallbacks() <fallbacks-public>`.
    * All other uses of `FallbackQueryset` can be safely replaced with a regular
      :class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet`.

- Translated admin no longer shows objects lacking a translation. This was
  already the case on Django 1.9 and newer, and this behavior now extends
  to all Django versions.
  Such objects should not happen anyway, and throw a warning when encountered.

Fixes:

- Increase speed of translated attribute access by ~30%, by avoiding a method call
  when a translation is loaded.
- Attempting to use a reserved name for a translated field now raises an
  :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` exception instead of silently
  ignoring the field.
- Instances created by serializers using
  :class:`~hvad.contrib.restframework.serializers.TranslatableModelMixin`
  in normal, non-*enforcing* mode can no longer be created without a translation.
  — :issue:`322`.

*****************************
1.7.0
*****************************

Released on February 8, 2017

New features:

- Support for :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.defer` and
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.only` was added. Note that deferring
  all translated fields will **not** result in translation being skipped,
  because 1) it needs to be inspected for language resolution and 2) loaded
  translation language must be fixed at query time.
  Support is limited to immediate fields at the moment, ie it is not possible
  to defer fields of additionals models loaded through ``select_related()``.

Compatibility warnings:

- Internal admin method ``TranslatableAdmin.get_available_languages()``
  is deprecated and will be removed. Use :meth:`TranslatableModel.get_available_languages()
  <hvad.models.TranslatableModel.get_available_languages>` instead.
- Internal admin method ``TranslatableAdmin.get_language_tabs()`` signature changed.

Fixes:

- Do not consider annotations when looking up translatable query fields.
  Fixes errors that could arise when using some annotation names.
  — :issue:`303`.
- Accept special value ``__all__`` for form field list, as a synonym for ``None``,
  meaning include all known fields. — :issue:`313`.
- Fix translation deletion links that were improperly generated when using inline
  change forms. — :issue:`317`.

*****************************
1.6.0
*****************************

Released on September 6, 2016

Python and Django versions supported:

- Support for Django 1.10 was added. It requires version 1.10.1 or better.
- So, as a reminder, supported Django versions for this release are: 1.7, 1.8 LTS, 1.9, 1.10.x (for x ≥ 1).

Fixes:

- No longer set ``master`` to ``NULL`` before clearing translations when using
  :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.delete_translations`. This only
  triggers one query instead of two, and allows enforcing non-null foreign key
  at the database level.
- Django system checks are now run in the test suite in addition to hvad's tests.

.. release 1.5.1

*****************************
1.5.1
*****************************

Released on May 23, 2016

Fixes:

- Filter out m2m and generic fields in
  :meth:`~hvad.contrib.restframework.serializers.TranslationsMixin.update_translation`
  so it does not bite when using (unsupported) m2m fields or generic relations in a
  translation — :issue:`285`.

.. release 1.5.0

*****************************
1.5.0
*****************************

Released on February 2, 2016

Python and Django versions supported:

- Django 1.4 LTS is no longer supported.
- So, as a reminder, supported Django versions for this release are: 1.7, 1.8 LTS, 1.9.

New features:

- It is now possible to specify a :ref:`custom translation base <custom-translation-models>`
  model, allowing advanced translation manipulation, such as controlling their loading
  with :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.from_db`.
- Translated model's :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save` method now accepts translated field
  names in ``update_fields``. Also, if only translated fields, or only untranslated fields
  are specified in ``update_fields``, the extra query will be skipped.
- Support for third parameter on ``ModelAdmin``'s
  :meth:`~django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin.get_object` method was added.
- Experimental support for using :ref:`language('all') <language-public>` together with
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related` is being introduced. Please
  check the generated queries if you use it. Feedback is appreciated.

Compatibility Warnings:

- Saving of translations now happens in the model's :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save` method.
  It used to happen in the ``post_save`` signal.
- ``TranslationsMixin`` now splits the update into ``update`` and ``update_translation`` methods.
  The former is called once per save, and uses the latter as many times as required to update
  all translations.

Fixes:

- Translation deletion URIs are no longer broken on Django 1.9 — :issue:`279`.
- REST framework translation support now uses ``update_fields`` to reduce the number of queries
  when updating an object.
- REST framework translation support no longer breaks when using ``PrimaryKeyRelatedField`` and
  ``TranslationsMixin`` together — :issue:`278`.
- Admin no longer uses deprecated ``patterns`` function — :issue:`268`.

.. release 1.4.0

*****************************
1.4.0
*****************************

Released on November 10, 2015

Python and Django versions supported:

- Support for Python 3.5 was added.
- Support for Django 1.9 was added.
- Django 1.6 is no longer officially supported.
- Django 1.4 LTS has reached its end of life, and support will be dropped in hvad 1.5.
- So, as a reminder, supported versions for this release are: 1.4 LTS, 1.7, 1.8 LTS, 1.9.

Compatibility Warnings:

- As a result of the annotations fix (see below), applications that worked around
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate`'s shortcomings on translation
  querysets are likely to break, as ``annotate()`` has been fixed. The
  workarounds should be simply removed.
- Method :meth:`FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks() <hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks>`
  is **not** supported on Django 1.9 and newer (and deprecated on other versions, see
  below). Please use :ref:`TranslationQueryset.fallbacks() <fallbacks-public>` instead.
- Translated admin no longer shows objects lacking a translation, starting from
  Django 1.9. This behavior will be extended to all Django versions in the next release.
  Such objects should not happen anyway, and throw a warning when encountered.
- Translation model building has been refactored. It is functionally equivalent to its previous
  implementation (it passes the exact same test suite), but code depending on the internals
  and inner implementation details could break.

Deprecation List:

- Method :meth:`FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks() <hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks>`
  is now deprecated on Django 1.6 and newer. The plan is to completely drop
  :class:`~hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset` in the near future, and let
  :meth:`TranslationManager.untranslated() <hvad.manager.TranslationManager.untranslated>`
  default to returning a plain Django queryset, thus enabling
  ``MyModel.objects.untranslated()`` to give access to all features a plain
  Django queryset supports.

  For queries that need fallbacks, the ``use_fallbacks()`` method has long been
  superseded by :ref:`TranslationQueryset.fallbacks() <fallbacks-public>`, which is
  better tested, uses simpler code yet supports more features.
  Please update your queries accordingly.

  ``MyModel.objects.untranslated().use_fallbacks('en', 'ja', 'fr')`` should be
  rewritten as ``MyModel.objects.language('en').fallbacks('ja', 'fr')``, or even
  ``MyModel.objects.language().fallbacks()`` to have the query use your application's
  language settings automatically.

Fixes:

- Annotations added to a :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset` using the
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate` method no longer end up on
  the translation cache with a ``master__`` prefix.
- Specifying translation fields in ``unique_together`` on translatable models
  no longer causes Django to generate incorrect migrations. — :issue:`260`.
- When no ``Meta`` options are set on a :ref:`TranslatableModelForm <translatablemodelform>`,
  the auto-created one now correctly inherits that of its first base class that
  has one set — :issue:`262`.
- Using ``language('all')`` together with ``values()`` no longer breaks — :issue:`264`.

.. release 1.3.0

*****************************
1.3.0
*****************************

Released on July 29, 2015

This release is a collection of fixes and improvements, some of which may
introduce minor compatibility issues. Please make sure you fix any deprecation
warnings before upgrading to avoid those issues.

Python and Django versions supported:

- Django 1.5 is no longer officially supported.
- Django 1.6 has reached its end of life, and support will be dropped in hvad 1.4.
- As a reminder, Django 1.4 is still supported, so supported versions for this
  release are: 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8.

New Features:

- Russian and Latvian translations are now included, thanks to Juris Malinens — :issue:`248`.

Compatibility Warnings: deprecated features pending removal in 1.3 have been
removed. Most notably:

- Calling ``save()`` on an invalid form now raises an assertion exception.
- Classes ``TranslatableModelBase``, ``TranslationFallbackManager``,
  ``TranslatableBaseView`` and method ``TranslationManager.using_translations()``
  no longer exist.
- Deprecated view methods and context modifiers now raise an assertion exception.

Fixes:

- Lift Django restrictions on translated fields in ``Meta.unique_together`` and
  ``Meta.index_together`` — :issue:`252`.
- Properly forward model validation methods to translation validation methods, so
  that model validation detects constraint violations on the translation as well.
  Fixes duplicate detection in admin for unique constraints on translations — :issue:`251`.
- Detect name clash between translated and non-translated fields — :issue:`240`.
- Validate that at least one translation is provided when deserializing objects in
  :class:`~hvad.contrib.restframework.TranslationsMixin` — :issue:`256`.
- Fix handling of model edition from an admin popup in Django 1.7 and newer — :issue:`253`.
- Generate proper ORM structures for fallbacks. Avoids table relabeling breaking
  queries, for instance when using ``update()`` or feeding a queryset to another
  queryset — :issue:`250`.

.. release 1.2.2

*****************************
1.2.2
*****************************

Released on June 3, 2015

Fixes:

- Properly handle ``language_code`` in ``Meta.unique_together`` and
  ``Meta.index_together`` — :issue:`244`.

.. release 1.2.1

*****************************
1.2.1
*****************************

Released on April 29, 2015

Fixes:

- Make passing the ``model`` argument to queryset's ``__init__`` optional. Still
  allow it to be passed either as a positional or named argument — :issue:`241`.

.. release 1.2.0

*****************************
1.2.0
*****************************

Released on March 19, 2015

This is a feature release, to push REST framework support onto the main package.

Python and Django versions supported:

- Due to this version being released early, end of support for
  Django 1.5 has been postponed until next release.

New features:

- Support for Django REST framework is now included. It requires REST framework
  version 3.1 or newer — :issue:`220`.

.. release 1.1.1

*****************************
1.1.1
*****************************

Released on March 5, 2015

Fixes:

- Backwards compatibility issue in get_field implementation — :issue:`233`.
- Admin no longer breaks on models using another ``pk`` field than ``id`` — :issue:`231`.

.. release 1.1.0

*****************************
1.1.0
*****************************

Released on February 17, 2015

Python and Django versions supported:

- hvad now supports Django 1.8.
- Django 1.5 has reached its end of life, and support will be dropped in hvad 1.2.
  Note however that Django 1.4 will still be supported.

New features:

- It is now possible to use translated fields in the
  :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.unique_together` and
  :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.index_together` settings on
  :doc:`TranslatableModel <models>`. They cannot be mixed in a single constraint
  though, as table-spanning indexes are not supported by SQL databases.
- The :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate` method is now supported. Support
  is still basic for now: annotations may not access more than one level of relation.

Compatibility warnings:

- Internal module ``hvad.fieldtranslator`` was no longer used, and was incompatible with
  Django 1.8. It has been removed.
- Deprecated :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.using_translations` has been removed.
  It can be safely replaced by :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language`.
- Deprecated :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationFallbackManager` has been removed. Please
  use manager's :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.untranslated` method instead.
- Deprecated :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatableModelBase` metaclass has been removed.
  Since release 0.5, hvad does not trigger metaclass conflicts anymore – :issue:`188`.
- Overriding the language in :meth:`QuerySet.get() <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get>`
  and :meth:`QuerySet.filter() <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.filter>` was
  deprecated in release 0.5, and has now been removed. Either use the
  :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language` method to set the
  correct language, or specify
  :meth:`language('all') <hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language>` to filter
  manually through ``get`` and ``filter`` – :issue:`182`.
- ``TranslatableModel``'s Internal attribute ``_shared_field_names`` has been removed.

Deprecation list:

- Passing ``unique_together`` or ``index_together`` as a ``meta`` option on
  :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatedFields` is now deprecated and will be unsupported
  in release 1.3. Put them in the model's :djterm:`Meta <meta-options>`
  instead, alongside normal fields.
- Calling ``save()`` on an invalid :ref:`TranslatableModelForm <translatablemodelform>`
  is a bad practice and breaks on regular Django forms. This is now deprecated,
  and relevant checks will be removed in release 1.3. Please check the form is
  valid before saving it.
- Generic views in ``hvad.views`` have been refactored to follow Django generic
  view behaviors. As a result, several non-standard methods are now deprecated.
  Please replace them with their Django equivalents — check :issue:`225`.

.. release 1.0.0

*****************************
1.0.0
*****************************

Released on December 19, 2014

Python and Django versions supported:

- Django 1.3 is no longer supported.
- Python 2.6 is no longer supported. Though it is likely to work for the time
  being, it has been dropped from the tested setups.

New features:

- :ref:`TranslatableModelForm <translatablemodelform>` has been refactored to make
  its behavior more consistent. As a result, it exposes two distinct language
  selection modes, *normal* and *enforce*, and has a clear API for manually
  overriding the language — :issue:`221`.
- The new features of :func:`~django.forms.models.modelform_factory` introduced by
  Django 1.6 and 1.7 are now available on
  :ref:`translatable_modelform_factory <translatablemodelformfactory>` as
  well — :issue:`221`.
- :ref:`TranslationQueryset <TranslationQueryset-public>` now has a
  :ref:`fallbacks() <fallbacks-public>` method when running on
  Django 1.6 or newer, allowing the queryset to use fallback languages while
  retaining all its normal functionalities – :issue:`184`.
- Passing additional ``select`` items in method
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.extra` is now supported. — :issue:`207`.
- It is now possible to use :ref:`TranslationQueryset <TranslationQueryset-public>`
  as default queryset for translatable models. — :issue:`207`.
- A lot of tests have been added, hvad now has 100% coverage on its core modules.
  Miscellaneous glitches found in this process were fixed.
- Added MySQL to tested database backends on Python 2.7.

Compatibility warnings:

- :ref:`TranslatableModelForm <translatablemodelform>` has been refactored to make
  its behavior more consistent. The core API has not changed, but edge cases are
  now clearly specified and some inconsistencies have disappeared, which could
  create issues, especially:

  - Direct use of the form class, without passing through the
    :ref:`factory method <translatablemodelformfactory>`. This used to have an
    unspecified behavior regarding language selection. Behavior is now
    well-defined. Please ensure it works the way you expect it to.

Fixes:

- :ref:`TranslatableModelForm <translatablemodelform>`'s
  :meth:`~django.forms.Form.clean` can now return `None` as per the new semantics
  introduced in Django 1.7. — :issue:`217`.
- Using ``Q object`` logical combinations or
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.exclude` on a translation-aware
  manager returned by :func:`~hvad.utils.get_translation_aware_manager` no longer
  yields wrong results.
- Method :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get_or_create` now properly deals
  with Django 1.6-style transactions.

.. release 0.5.2

*****************************
0.5.2
*****************************

Released on November 8, 2014

Fixes:

- Admin does not break anymore on M2M fields on latest Django versions. — :issue:`212`.
- Related fields's :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.clear`
  method now works properly (it used to break on MySQL, and was inefficient on
  other engines) — :issue:`212`.

.. release 0.5.1

*****************************
0.5.1
*****************************

Released on October 24, 2014

Fixes:

- Ecountering a regular (un-translatable) model in a deep `select_related` does
  not break anymore. — :issue:`206`.
- Language tabs URI are now correctly generated when changelist filters are used.
  — :issue:`203`.
- Admin language tab selection is no longer lost when change filters are active.
  — :issue:`202`.

.. release 0.5.0

*****************************
0.5.0
*****************************

Released on September 11, 2014

New features:

- New :ref:`translationformset_factory <translationformset>` and its companion
  :class:`~hvad.forms.BaseTranslationFormSet` allow building a formset to work
  on an instance's translations. Please have at look at its detailed
  :ref:`documentation <translationformset>` – :issue:`157`.
- Method :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset.language` now accepts the
  special value ``'all'``, allowing the query to consider all translations – :issue:`181`.
- Django 1.6+'s new :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.datetimes` method is
  now available on :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset` too – :issue:`175`.
- Django 1.6+'s new :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.earliest` method is
  now available on :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset`.
- Calls to :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset.language`, passing ``None``
  to use the current language now defers language resolution until the query is
  evaluated. It can now be used in form definitions directly, for instance for
  passing a custom queryset to :class:`~django.forms.ModelChoiceField` – :issue:`171`.
- Similarly, :meth:`~hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks` can now be
  passed ``None`` as one of the fallbacks, and it will be replaced with current
  language at query evaluation time.
- All queryset classes used by :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager` can now
  be customized thanks to the new :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.fallback_class`
  and :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.default_class` attributes.
- Abstract models are now supported. The concrete class must still declare a
  :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatedFields` instance, but it can be empty – :issue:`180`.
- Django-hvad messages are now available in Italian – :issue:`178`.
- The :attr:`Meta.ordering <django.db.models.Options.ordering>` model setting
  is now supported on translatable models. It accepts both translated and shared
  fields – :issue:`185`, :issue:`12`.
- The :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset.select_related` method is no longer
  limited to 1 level depth – :issue:`192`.
- The :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset.select_related` method semantics
  is now consistent with that of regular querysets. It supports passing ``None``
  to clear the list and mutiple calls mimic Django behavior. That is: cumulative
  starting from Django 1.7 and substitutive before – :issue:`192`.

Deprecation list:

- The deprecated ``nani`` module was removed.
- Method :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.using_translations` is now deprecated.
  It can be safely replaced by :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language`
  with no arguments.
- Setting ``NANI_TABLE_NAME_SEPARATOR`` was renamed to ``HVAD_TABLE_NAME_SEPARATOR``.
  Using the old name will still work for now, but issue a deprecation warning,
  and get removed in next version.
- CSS class ``nani-language-tabs`` in admin templates was renamed to
  ``hvad-language-tabs``. Entities will bear both classes until next version.
- Private ``_real_manager`` and ``_fallback_manager`` attributes of
  :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset` have been removed as the indirection
  served no real purpose.
- The :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationFallbackManager` is deprecated and will
  be removed in next release. Please use manager's
  :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.untranslated` method instead.
- The :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatableModelBase` metaclass is no longer
  necessary and will be removed in next release. hvad no longer triggers metaclass
  conflicts and ``TranslatableModelBase`` can be safely dropped – :issue:`188`.
- Overriding the language in :meth:`QuerySet.get() <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get>`
  and :meth:`QuerySet.filter() <django.db.models.query.QuerySet.filter>` is now
  deprecated. Either use the :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language`
  method to set the correct language, or specify
  :meth:`language('all') <hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language>` to filter
  manually through ``get`` and ``filter`` – :issue:`182`.

Fixes:

- Method :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` now works when passed
  no field name, properly getting the field name from the model's
  :attr:`Meta.get_latest_by <django.db.models.Options.get_latest_by>` option.
- :class:`~hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset` now leverages the better control on
  queries allowed in Django 1.6 and newer to use only one query to resolve
  fallbacks. Old behavior can be forced by adding ``HVAD_LEGACY_FALLBACKS = True``
  to your settings.
- Assigning value to translatable foreign keys through its ``_id`` field no
  longer results in assigned value being ignored – :issue:`193`.
- Tests were refactored to fully support PostgreSQL – :issue:`194`

.. release 0.4.1

*****************************
0.4.1
*****************************

Released on June 1, 2014

Fixes:

- Translations no longer remain in database when deleted depending on
  the query that deleted them – :issue:`183`.
- :meth:`~hvad.models.TranslatableModel.get_available_languages` now
  uses translations if they were prefetched with
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.prefetch_related`.  Especially, using
  :meth:`~hvad.admin.TranslatableAdmin.all_translations` in
  :attr:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display` no longer results in one
  query per item, as long as translations were prefetched –
  :issue:`179`, :issue:`97`.


.. release 0.4.0

*****************************
0.4.0
*****************************

Released on May 19, 2014

New Python and Django versions supported:

- django-hvad now supports Django 1.7 running on Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.
- django-hvad now supports Django 1.6 running on Python 2.7 and 3.3.

New features:

- :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager`'s queryset class can now be overriden by
  setting its :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.queryset_class` attribute.
- Proxy models can be used with django-hvad. This is a new feature, please
  use with caution and report any issue on github.
- :class:`~hvad.admin.TranslatableAdmin`'s list display now has direct links
  to each available translation.
- Instance's translated fields are now available to the model's
  :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save` method when saving a
  :class:`~hvad.forms.TranslatableModelForm`.
- Accessing a translated field on an untranslated instance will now raise an
  :exc:`~exceptions.AttributeError` with a helpful message instead of letting the
  exception bubble up from the ORM.
- Method :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset.in_bulk` is now available on
  :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset`.

Deprecation list:

- Catching :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist` when accessing
  a translated field on an instance is deprecated. In case no translation
  is loaded and none exists in database for current language, an
  :exc:`~exceptions.AttributeError` is raised instead. For the transition,
  both are supported until next release.

Removal of the old ``'nani'`` aliases was postponed until next release.

Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where :class:`~hvad.admin.TranslatableAdmin` could overwrite the
  wrong language while saving a form.
- :meth:`~hvad.models.TranslatableModel.lazy_translation_getter` now tries
  translations in :setting:`LANGUAGES` order once it has failed with current
  language and site's main :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE`.
- No more deprecation warnings when importing only from ``hvad``.
- :class:`~hvad.admin.TranslatableAdmin` now generates relative URLs instead
  of absolute ones, enabling it to work behind reverse proxies.
- django-hvad does not depend on the default manager being named
  'objects' anymore.
- Q objects now work properly with :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset`.

       was the implicit default until 0.1.0)

* Replaced our ghetto fallback querying code with a simplified version of the
  logic used in Bert Constantins `django-polymorphic`_, all credit for our now
  better FallbackQueryset code goes to him.
* Replaced all JSON fixtures for testing with Python fixtures, to keep tests
  maintainable.
* Nicer language tabs in admin thanks to the amazing help of Angelo Dini.
* Ability to delete translations from the admin.
* Changed hvad.admin.TranslatableAdmin.get_language_tabs signature.
* Removed tests from egg.
* Fixed some tests possibly leaking client state information.
* Fixed a critical bug in hvad.forms.TranslatableModelForm where attempting to
  save a translated model with a relation (FK) would cause IntegrityErrors when
  it's a new instance.
* Fixed a critical bug in hvad.models.TranslatableModelBase where certain field
  types on models would break the metaclass. (Many thanks to Kristian
  Oellegaard for the fix)
* Fixed a bug that prevented abstract TranslatableModel subclasses with no
  translated fields.
