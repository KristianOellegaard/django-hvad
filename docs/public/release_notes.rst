 * A new setting was introduced to configure the table name separator, ``NANI_TABLE_NAME_SEPARATOR``.

   .. note::

       If you upgrade from an earlier version, you'll have to rename your tables yourself (the general template is
       ``appname_modelname_translation``) or set ``NANI_TABLE_NAME_SEPARATOR`` to the empty string in your settings (which
       was the implicit default until 0.1.0)

0.0.3 (Alpha)
*************

Released on May 26, 2011.

* Replaced our ghetto fallback querying code with a simplified version of the
  logic used in Bert Constantins `django-polymorphic`_, all credit for our now
  better FallbackQueryset code goes to him.
* Replaced all JSON fixtures for testing with Python fixtures, to keep tests
  maintainable.
* Nicer language tabs in admin thanks to the amazing help of Angelo Dini.
* Ability to delete translations from the admin.
* Changed hvad.admin.TranslatableAdmin.get_language_tabs signature.
* Removed tests from egg.
* Fixed some tests possibly leaking client state information.
* Fixed a critical bug in hvad.forms.TranslatableModelForm where attempting to
  save a translated model with a relation (FK) would cause IntegrityErrors when
  it's a new instance.
* Fixed a critical bug in hvad.models.TranslatableModelBase where certain field
  types on models would break the metaclass. (Many thanks to Kristian
  Oellegaard for the fix)
* Fixed a bug that prevented abstract TranslatableModel subclasses with no
  translated fields.
