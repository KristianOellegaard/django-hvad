Defining models
***************

Defining models with django-hvad is done by inheriting
:class:`~hvad.models.TranslatableModel`. Model definition works like in
regular Django, with the following additional features:

- Translatable fields can be defined on the model, by wrapping them in a
  :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatedFields` instance, and assigning it to an
  attribute on the model. That attribute will be used to access the
  :term:`translations <Translations Model>` of your model directly. Behind the
  scenes, it will be a reversed ForeignKey from the
  :term:`Translations Model` to your :term:`Shared Model`.
- Translatable fields can be used in the model options. For options that take
  groupings of fields (``unique_together`` and ``index_together``), each grouping
  may have either translatable or non-translatable fields, but not both.
- Special field ``language_code`` is automatically created by hvad, and may be used
  for defining ``unique_together`` constraints that are only unique per language.

A full example of a model with translations::

    from django.db import models
    from hvad.models import TranslatableModel, TranslatedFields

    class TVSeries(TranslatableModel):
        distributor = models.CharField(max_length=255)

        translations = TranslatedFields(
            title = models.CharField(max_length=100),
            subtitle = models.CharField(max_length=255),
            released = models.DateTimeField(),
        )
        class Meta:
            unique_together = [('title', 'subtitle')]

.. note:: The :djterm:`Meta <meta-options>` class of the model may not use the
          translatable fields in :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.order_with_respect_to`.
.. note:: TranslatedFields cannot contain a field named ``master``, as this name
          is reserved by hvad to refer to the :term:`Shared Model`. Also, special
          field ``language_code`` can be overriden in order to set it to be a
          different type of field, or change its options.

***********************
New and Changed Methods
***********************

translate
=========

.. method:: translate(language_code)

    Prepares a new translation for this instance for the language specified.

    .. note:: This method does not perform any database queries. It assumes the
              translation does not exist. If it does exist, trying to save the
              instance will raise an :exc:`~django.db.IntegrityError`.


safe_translation_getter
=======================

.. method:: safe_translation_getter(name, default=None)

    Returns the value of the field specified by ``name`` if it's available on
    this instance in the currently cached language. It does not try to get the
    value from the database. Returns the value specified in ``default`` if no
    translation was cached on this instance or the translation does not have a
    value for this field.

    This method is useful to safely get a value in methods such as
    :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.__unicode__`.

    .. note:: This method never performs any database queries.

Example usage::

    class MyModel(TranslatableModel):
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        )

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.safe_translation_getter('name', str(self.pk))


lazy_translation_getter
=======================

.. versionchanged:: 0.4
.. method:: lazy_translation_getter(name, default=None)

    Tries to get the value of the field specified by ``name`` using
    :meth:`safe_translation_getter`. If this fails, tries to load a translation
    from the database. If none exists, returns the value specified in ``default``.

    This method is useful to get a value in methods such as
    :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.__unicode__`.


get_available_languages
=======================

.. method:: get_available_languages

    Returns a list of available language codes for this instance.

    .. note:: This method runs a database query to fetch the available
              languages, unless they were prefetched before (if the instance
              was retrieved with a call to ``prefetch_related('translations')``).


save
====

.. method:: save(force_insert=False, force_update=False, using=None, update_fields=None)

    Overrides :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save`.

    This method runs an extra query to save the translation cached on
    this instance, if any translation was cached.

    It accepts both translated and untranslated fields in ``update_fields``.

    - If only untranslated fields are specified, the extra query will be skipped.
    - If only translated fields are specified, the shared model update will be skipped.
      Note that this means signals will not be triggered.


**********************
Working with relations
**********************

Foreign keys pointing to a :term:`Translated Model` always point to the
:term:`Shared Model`. It is not possible to have a foreign key to a
:term:`Translations Model`.

Please note that :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related` used on
a foreign key pointing from a :term:`normal model <Normal Model>` to a
:term:`translatable model <Translated Model>` does not span to its
:term:`translations <Translations Model>` and therefore accessing a translated
field over the relation will cause an extra query. Foreign keys from a
translatable model do not have this restriction.

If you wish to filter over a translated field over the relation from a
:term:`Normal Model` you have to use
:func:`~hvad.utils.get_translation_aware_manager` to get a manager that allows
you to do so. That function takes your model class as argument and returns a
manager that works with translated fields on related models.

**************************
Advanced Model Definitions
**************************

Abstract Models
===============

.. versionadded:: 0.5

:djterm:`Abstract models <abstract-base-classes>` can be used normally with hvad.
Untranslatable fields of the base models will remain untranslatable, while
translatable fields will be translatable on the concrete model as well::

    class Place(TranslatableModel):
        coordinates = models.CharField(max_length=64)
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255),
        )
        class Meta:
            abstract = True

    class Restaurant(Place):
        score = models.PositiveIntegerField()
        translations = TranslatedFields()   # see note below

.. note:: The concrete models **must** have a :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatedFields`
          instance as one of their attributes. This is required because this
          attribute will be used to access the translations. It can be empty.

Proxy Models
============

.. versionadded:: 0.4

:djterm:`Proxy models <proxy-models>` can be used normally with hvad, with the
following restrictions:

- The ``__init__`` method of the proxy model will not be called when it is
  loaded from the database.
- As a result, the :attr:`~django.db.models.signals.pre_init` and
  :data:`~django.db.models.signals.post_init` signals will not be sent for
  the proxy model either.

The ``__init__`` method and signals for the concrete model will still be called.

Multi-table Inheritance
=======================

Unfortunately, multi-table inheritance is not supported, and unlikely to be.
Please read :issue:`230` about the issues with multi-table inheritance.

.. _custom-managers:

*****************************
Custom Managers and Querysets
*****************************

Custom Manager
==============

Vanilla :class:`managers <django.db.models.Manager>`, using vanilla
:class:`querysets <django.db.models.query.QuerySet>` can be used with translatable
models. However, they will not have access to translations or translatable fields.
Also, such a vanilla manager cannot server as a
:djterm:`default manager <default managers>` for the model. The default manager
**must** be translation aware.

To have full access to translations and translatable fields, custom managers
must inherit :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager` and custom querysets
must inherit either :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset` (enabling the
use of :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset.language`) or
:class:`~hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset` (enabling the use of
:meth:`~hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset.use_fallbacks`). Both are described in the
:doc:`dedicated section <queryset>`.

Custom Querysets
================

Once you have a custom queryset, you can use it to override the default ones
in your manager. This is where it is more complex than a regular manager:
:class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager` uses three types of queryset, that
can be overriden independently:

- :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.queryset_class` must inherit
  :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationQueryset`, and will be used for all queries
  that call the :meth:`language() <hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language>` method.
- :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.fallback_class` must inherit
  :class:`~hvad.manager.FallbackQueryset`, and will be used for all queries
  that call the :meth:`untranslated() <hvad.manager.TranslationManager.untranslated>`
  method.
- :attr:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.default_class` may be any kind of
  queryset (a ``TranslationQueryset``, a ``FallbackQueryset`` or a plain
  :class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet`). It will be used for all queries
  that call neither ``language`` nor ``untranslated``. It defaults to being a
  regular, translation-unaware ``QuerySet`` for compatibility, see next section
  about overriding it.

As a convenience, it is possible to override the queryset at manager instanciation,
avoiding the need to subclass the manager::

    class TVSeriesTranslationQueryset(TranslationQueryset):
        def is_public_domain(self):
            threshold = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365*70)
            return self.filter(released__gt=threshold)

    class TVSeries(TranslatableModel):
        # ... (see full definition in previous example)
        objects = TranslationManager(queryset_class=TVSeriesTranslationQueryset)

.. _override-default-queryset:

Overriding Default Queryset
===========================

.. versionadded:: 0.6

By default, the :class:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager` returns a vanilla,
translation-unaware :class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` when a query is
done without either :meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.language` or
:meth:`~hvad.manager.TranslationManager.untranslated`. This conservative
behavior makes it compatible with third party modules. It is, however, possible
to set it to be translation-aware by overriding it::

    class MyModel(TranslatableModel):
        objects = TranslationManager(default_class=TranslationQueryset)

This deeply changes key behaviors of the manager, with many benefits:

- The call to ``language()`` can be omitted, filtering on translations is
  implied in all queries. It is still possible to use it to set another language
  on the queryset.
- As a consequence, all third-party modules will only see objects in current
  language, unless they are hvad-aware.
- They will also gain access to translated fields.
- Queries that use :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.prefetch_related` will
  prefetch the translation as well (in current language).
- Acessing a translatable model from a :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` or a
  :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey` will also load
  and cache the translation in current language.

In other terms, all queries become translation-aware by default.

.. warning:: Some third-party modules may break if they rely on the ability
             to see all objects. `MPTT`_, for instance, will corrupt its tree
             if some objects have no translation in current language.
             Use caution when combining this feature with other manager-altering
             modules.

.. _custom-translation-models:

Custom Translation Models
=========================

.. versionadded:: 1.5

It is possible to have :term:`translations <Translations Model>` use a custom base
class, by specifying a ``base_class`` argument to :class:`~hvad.models.TranslatedFields`.
This may be useful for advanced manipulation of translations, such as customizing some
model methods, for instance :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.from_db`::

    class BookTranslation(models.Model):
        @classmethod
        def from_db(cls, db, fields, values):
            obj = super(BookTranslation, self).from_db(cls, db, field, values)
            obj.loaded_at = timezone.now()
            return obj

        class Meta:
            abstract = True

    class Book(TranslatableModel):
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            base_class = BookTranslation,
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255),
        )

In this example, the ``Book``'s translation model will have ``BookTranslation`` as its
first base class, so every translation will have a ``loaded_at`` attribute when loaded
from the database. Keep in mind this attribute will *not* be available on the book itself,
but can be accessed through ``get_cached_translation(book).loaded_at``.

Such classes are inserted into the translations inheritance tree, so if some other model
inherits ``Book``, its translations will also inherit ``BookTranslation``.

--------

Next, we will detail the :doc:`translation-aware querysets <queryset>` provided
by hvad.
