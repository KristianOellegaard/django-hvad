Welcome to the Django hvad documentation!

.. warning:: Please note that django-hvad is still in alpha status and should be
             used with caution.

.. note:: django-hvad is closely related (and derives) from django-nani.
           Don't be confused if that name is used in the docs or elsewhere,
           many of the functions are also compatible with django-nani.

******************
About this project
******************

django-hvad provides a high level API to maintain multilingual content in your
database using the Django ORM.

*************************
Before you dive into this
*************************

Please note that this documentation assumes that you are very familiar with 
Django and Python, if you are not, please familiarize yourself with those first.

While django-hvad tries to be as simple to use as possible, it's still
recommended that you only use it if you consider yourself to be very strong in
Python and Django.
