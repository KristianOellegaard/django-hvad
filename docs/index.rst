About this project
******************

django-hvad provides a high level API to maintain multilingual content in your
database using the Django ORM.

Please note that this documentation assumes that you are familiar with
Django and Python, if you are not, please familiarize yourself with those first.

Notes on Django versions
************************

The guideline is hvad supports all Django versions that are supported by the
Django team. This holds true for Long-Term Support releases as well. Support for
new versions will usually be introduced when they reach the beta stage.

Thus, django-hvad 2.0 is tested on the following configurations:

- Django 2.1.2, running Python 3.5 or 3.6.

As django-hvad 2.0 is incompatible with older releases, django-hvad 1.8.0 is still
supported with:

- Django 1.11, running Python 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5.

All tests are run against MySQL and PostgreSQL.
