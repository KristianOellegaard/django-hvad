.. module:: hvad.utils

.. function:: translation_rater(*languages)

    Returns a translation rater for the given set of languages. That translation
    rater is a function that, given a :term:`Translations Model`, returns an
    integer whose value decreases the more its language is far in the given
    language list. If its language is not in the list at all, returns
    the minimum score of **-1**.

    If language list is omitted, a default list is built, given scores in decreasing
    order to:

        * current language
        * site's default language
        * site's fallback languages

    Example::

        # Get a list of instance's translations, from most relevant to less relevant
        # language:
        translations = sorted(instance.translations.all(),
                              key=translation_rater(), reverse=True)

.. function:: get_cached_translation(instance)

    Returns the cached translation from an instance or ``None``.
    Encapsulates a :func:`getattr` using the model's **translations_cache**.

.. function:: set_cached_translation(instance, translation)

    Sets the currently cached translation for the instance, and returns the
    translation that was loaded before the call. Passing ``None`` as translation
    will unload current translation and let the instance untranslated.

.. function:: combine(trans, klass)

    Combines a :term:`Shared Model` with a :term:`Translations Model` by taking
    the :term:`Translations Model` and setting it onto the
    :term:`Shared Model`'s translations cache.

    **klass** is the :term:`Shared Model` class. This argument is required as there
    is no way to distinguish a translation of a proxy model from that of a concrete
    model otherwise.

    This function is only intended for loading models from the database. For other
    uses, :func:`set_cached_translation` should be used instead.

.. function:: get_translation(instance, language_code=None)

    Returns the translation for an instance, in the specified language. If given
    language is None, uses :func:`~django.utils.translation.get_language` to get
    current language.

    Encapsulates a :func:`getattr` using the model's **translations_accessor** and
    a call to its :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get` method using the
    instance's primary key and given language_code as filters.

.. function:: load_translation(instance, language, enforce=False)

    Returns the translation for an instance.

    * If ``enforce`` is False, then ``language`` is used as a default language,
      if the ``instance`` has no language currently loaded.
    * If ``enforce`` is True, then ``language`` will be enforced upon the
      translation, ignoring cached translation if it is not in the given
      language.

    A valid translation instance is always returned. It will be loaded from the
    database as required. If this fails, a new, empty, ready-to-use translation
    will be returned.

    The instance itself is untouched.

.. function:: get_translation_aware_manager(model)

    Returns a manager for a normal model that is aware of translations and can
    filter over translated fields on translated models related to this normal
    model. 

.. class:: SmartGetFieldByName

    Smart version of the standard :meth:`get_field_by_name` on the options
    (meta) of Django models that raises a more useful exception when one tries
    to access translated fields with the wrong manager.

    This descriptor is pending deprecation as the associated method is being
    removed from Django.

    .. method:: __init__(self, real)

        Retains a reference to the actual method this descriptor is replacing.
    
    .. method:: __call__(self, meta, name)

        Catches improper use of the ``get_field_by_name`` method to access
        translated fields and raise a ``WrongManager`` exception.

.. class:: SmartGetField

    Smart version of the standard :meth:`get_field` on the options
    (meta) of Django models that raises a more useful exception when one tries
    to access translated fields with the wrong manager.

    .. method:: __init__(self, real)

        Retains a reference to the actual method this descriptor is replacing.

    .. method:: __call__(self, meta, name)

        Catches improper use of the ``get_field`` method to access
        translated fields and raise a ``WrongManager`` exception.

.. class:: _MinimumDjangoVersionDescriptor

    Helper class used by :func:`minimumDjangoVersion` decorator.

.. function:: minimumDjangoVersion(*args)

    Decorator that will catch attempts to use methods on a Django version that
    does not support them and raise a helpful exception.

    Arguments must be the minimum allowable Django version, the will be compared
    against the ``django.VERSION`` tuple.

.. function:: settings_updater(func):

    Decorator for setting globals depending on Django settings. It simply invokes
    the decorated function immediately, then calls it again every time the
    ``setting_changed`` signal is sent by Django.
